                    <p> 
                        In the 1990s, a British anthropologist, Dr. Robin Dunbar, suggested that there is a “cognitive limit to the number of individuals with whom any one person can maintain stable relationships.” The number of meaningful relationships he believes one person can have is roughly 150. This is a large number, yet many people go through life not having even one connection with a medical professional that they trust. 
                    </br> </br>
                        At 150 Bridges, we want to help bridge that gap. We understand that healthcare professionals want to help people. However, the system they work in tends limit developing a deep connection with communities. By connecting community-based organizations with specialized healthcare volunteers, we hope that meaningful connections are created, which will help improve healthcare access and trust in the medical field. 
                    </br> </br>
                       <b>Our Vision</b>
                    </br> </br>
                        Our vision is a world where healthcare expertise knows no boundaries, where medical professionals can effortlessly lend their skills to underserved communities locally and around the globe.

Therefore, we have created an platform that leverages technology to streamline the connection process, making it effortless for healthcare volunteers to share their skills and knowledge.
